# Dev Tools

This folder contains two methods of implementing a development environment locally to run the OIH framework.

- The [/minikube folder](minikube/) is based off of the basic minikube installation found in the [root minikube folder](../minikube). It adds the ability to optionally launch each service using local source code served over NFS instead of the public Docker image.
- The [/docker-compose folder](docker-compose/) contains configuration files and helper scripts to run local services directly from Docker. It still relies on minikube to execute flows.
- The [/test-component folder](test-component/) contains a dynamic test component which could be used within the docker-compose approach

Please see the documentation for each tool separately.
