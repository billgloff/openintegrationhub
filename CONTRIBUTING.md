# Before you get started

## Documentation and Installation

There are two main sources to find information on what the framework does and how to use it.

The [General Documentation](https://openintegrationhub.github.io/) that explains the basic concepts, how to set it up and what each service does. You will also find [Installation Guides](https://openintegrationhub.github.io/docs/3%20-%20Deployment/Intro.html) to do your own local or cloud deployment to test the framework.

The [Main Repository](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/openintegrationhub) contains the actual code as well as additional technical information for each service for instance regarding configuration options.

## Sign the Contributor License Agreement

It is important for you as a contributor as well as the project and all it's users, that we are clear on who owns the code. Therefore all contributions have to be made according to the License Agreement.

The Open Integration Hub project can only accept original source code from **Contributor License Agreement** signatories. This is not necessary for opening issues or giving us feedback. However before we can approve any pull requests and include code contributions, you will need to sign the **Contributor License Agreement**.

The [Cloud Ecosystem e.V.](https://www.cloudecosystem.org) is the neutral body governing the Open Integration Hub project and defines the legal status of the contributed code in two different types of _Contributor License Agreements_(CLAs): [individual contributors](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/BusinessCommittee/blob/master/Contributing/Guide/Contributor%20License%20Agreement%20INDIVIDUAL.pdf) and [companies](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/BusinessCommittee/blob/master/Contributing/Guide/Contributor%20License%20Agreement%20COMPANY.pdf).

# Your first Contribution

If you are new to oepn source development, welcome! Happy to have you checking out our project. It can be a lot to take in at first. Luckily there is a lot great content that helps you with creating your first issues, pull requests and how to contribute to an open source project in general. A good place to start is the official [GitHub Collaboration Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests).

## Issues

Use issues to bring attention to problems, features you would love to see or potential improvements. Issues are a major part of community collaboration and part of the documentation. So please take the time to really describe your issue in a way that others can understand.

We use issues to also show what we are currently working on. So check the existing issues. With tools like [ZenHub](https://github.com/marketplace?query=zenhub) you can also keep track of our development in a kanban sort of way.

To make it easier for you, we provide templates for several types of issues.

## Pull Requests

We are a community driven project. In order to make collaboration easy and pleasant for everyone, please mind some general prciniples when contributing:

1. Generalize your code. What anyone uses the framework for, is up to them. Avoid pushing your own tooling, configurations and customizations. They may work for you, but not for others.
2. Make it easy for others to understand. Break your contributions in small pieces, document the code and describe what you were trying to achive.
3. Test your code before contributing. And let us know what you tested it with - where do you run your instance, framework or service versions, notable individual changes in your setup.
4. Follow the process on GitHub. Use the templates and pass all automated checks.
